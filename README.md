##Name of project

Rickety Space Race

##Project Overview

For my first project my intention is to create my first gamem Space Race with the help of an online instructional listed below.

Update: I ran into challenges with the first big block of code. I'm not seeing the ship described. So I intened to use two other similar game video tuturials to work out the background and hopefully, get the ships to appear.

Update: It seams that as soon as I fill in my canvas ith black that I cannot get anything else to appear. So i am pivoting to strickly recreating the simpler game from the video tuturial. 

Update: I'm missing something. Following the instructions step by step and I still cannot get anything to appear within my frame.
